# Project structure

* `images`: contains source images to be ranked according to different metrics, including human

* `analysis`: contains code to calculate ranks based on different metrics
	* Each subdirectory represents one metric (e.g. MSE)
	* Each subdirectory contains the following files:
		* `process.py`: script to process data according using the metric
		* `rank.yaml`: autogenerated, contains rank output data
			* the top-level format is identical as `images.yaml`, that is, it has multiple variables named according to the name of the image set (e.g. `red_carpet`). But each variable is a list, where its elements are the keys of the images in `images.yaml`, and the first element represents the image *most similar* to the original image.

* `env.py`: contains environmental variables for python (e.g. `ROOT_DIR`)

* `env.sh`: to be sourced before running the project

* `images.yaml`: contains mappings from generic keys to the file's directory
	* data is in the form of multiple dictionaries, each dictionary is named based on the name of the image set (e.g. `red_carpet`); each dictionary contains mappings from the key to the file name relative to `ROOT_DIR`.
	* in each dictionary of image sets, the key `orig` is preserved for the original image.
