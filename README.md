# Project structure

>	Legends: 

>	Each list item is either a directory or a file, or multiple
>	directories/files, if they are followed with a asterisk ("\*") sign

>	Each list item has two parts, separated by a colon (":"), the part before
>	the colon is the name of the directory or the file, while the part after
>	the colon is a description for the directory or the file.

>	`directory/` names are followed by a slash, while `file` names are not
>	followed by a slash.

>	sub-directories and files for a given directory are nested below the given
>	directory.

>	if a name of a directory or a file contains a word surrounded by angle
>	bracket (`<placeholder>`), the word is a placeholder that can be replaced
>	by specific names according to the description. 

-   `start.py`: executable script implementing commands that can transform or
	analyze images accordingly

-   `images/`: contains source images to be ranked according to different
	metrics

	-   `<category>/`\*: contains a certain category of image. For example,
		'brick,' 'wheat,' etc.
		-   `orig.jpg`: the original image; everything else in this directory is
			derived from this image.
		-   `output.jpg`: the output image without being transformed with any
			specific transformation.
		-   `<transformation>/`\*: contains images that are transformed from the
			original image with a certain transformation. For example, 'crop,'
			'watermark,' etc.
			-   `level_[0-10].jpg`\*: images transformed with different
				intensity with the particular `<transformation>`. Level 0 is
				identical to `output.jpg`, and Level 10 is the most transformed.

-   `printables/`: contains the transformed images in printable format
	(currently only pdf format)
	-   `<category>_<transformation>.pdf`\*: the file containing all levels of
		transformed images in `<category>` transformed using `<transformation>`

-   `data/`: contains ranking data
	-   `human/`: contains human ranked data, manually typed
		-   `<id>.yaml`\*: data collected from person associated with `<id>`.
			Data has the following structure:
			-   `<category>_<transformation>`\*: a dictionary key
				-   `[ 4, 2, ... ]`: `4` signifies the image transformed with a
					level of 4. First element in the list is ranked the most
					similar to the original image.
	-   `metrics/`: contains computer ranked data, automatically generated by
		the `analyze` command
		-   `<metric>.yaml`\*: data generated by `<metric>`. E.g. MSE. Data has
			the same structure as human data.

-   `src/`: contains source code

	-   `transformations/`: contains code to transform images
		-   `<transformation>/`\*: represents a transformatio.For example, blur.
			-   `__init__.py`: contains a `transform(img, level): img` public
				function to transform a given image with the given `level`. The
				function should ensure that when `level` is 0, the image
				returned is identical to the image passed to it.

	-   `analysis/`: contains code to calculate ranks based on different metrics

		-   `<metric>/`\*: represents a metric. For example, MSE.
			-   `__init__.py`: contains a class definition of subclass derived
				from the `Analyzer` class, with a method `rate(orig, comp):
				float` to calculate the difference rating according to
				`<metric>`.

-   `env.sh`: to be sourced before running the project
